			<p>Hello Everybody my name is Jeremy Meltingtallow. I am a senior(YEA!!) at Eastern Washington University working on my Degrees for Computer Information Systems and Visual Communication Design.</p>

			<h3>Lets get deeper...</h3>
			<p>My first drawing that I can remember was a shoe made out of chalk on my driveway. The arches were magnificent and I think a couple cats sacrificed their bodies to color the Dorthy red leather. After my art won me a key to the city I moved to smaller things. <span>Now I mainly work with vector graphics and write server applications.</span></p>
