		<p>My name is Jeremy Meltingtallow and <span>I am a cat</span>. What type of cat? Well I am a cooooool cat. The kewlest cat meowin the block. Some say that my fur is golden in its rich texture and sexy gloss. What do I say to that? "MEOOOOW MEOOOOW". From now on I will refer to myself as MAOzzz.</p>


		<h3>Lets get deeper...</h3>
		<p>What does the MAOzzz study? Gosh, I guess the MAOzzz has enrolled himself in Computer Information Systems as well as Visual Communication Design.</p>

		<h4>Background Information</h4>
		<p>Let's start from the begining. I was born in a helecopter above a space balloon. As I squeezed through the barrier my claws cut our airborne saucer in half. As our transportation shred across the sky my name was developed and I knew I would be a designer.</p>

		<h4>Professional Objectives</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Make my own Cat Nip.</li>
			<li>Climb down from trees without regret.</li>
			<li>Take a nap from another cat and use it in front of him/her.</li>
			<li>Design a litter box that cleans inbetween my toes.</li>
		</ul>
